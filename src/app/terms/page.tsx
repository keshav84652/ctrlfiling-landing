            These Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") govern
            your relationship with the CTRL+Filing AI practice management platform (the "Service")
            operated by CTRL+Filing Inc. ("us", "we", or "our"). CTRL+Filing is specifically
            designed for accounting firms, certified public accountants (CPAs), and tax
            professionals to manage their practice operations, client data, and professional workflows.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before using our
            Service. These terms include important provisions regarding professional
            liability, client data handling, AI processing, and compliance requirements
            specific to accounting and tax practice management.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these
            Terms and acknowledge that you understand the professional responsibilities
            and regulatory requirements applicable to your use of AI tools in accounting
            practice. If you disagree with any part of the Terms, you may not
            access the Service.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Professional Service Subscriptions</h2>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            CTRL+Filing provides AI practice management services on a subscription basis
            ("Subscription(s)") specifically designed for accounting professionals. You will be billed in advance on a recurring
            and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set on a
            monthly or annual basis as selected during enrollment.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will
            automatically renew under the same conditions unless you cancel it
            or CTRL+Filing Inc. cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription
            through your online account management page or by contacting CTRL+Filing
            customer support. Cancellation does not affect your professional obligations
            regarding client data retention and accessibility.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            A valid payment method, including a credit card, is required. You
            must provide accurate and complete billing information, including
            valid professional license information. By submitting payment information, 
            you authorize us to charge Subscription fees to your chosen payment method.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            If automatic billing fails, CTRL+Filing Inc. will issue an invoice and
            require manual payment within a stated deadline. Suspension of service
            for non-payment does not relieve you of professional obligations to
            maintain client data accessibility and confidentiality.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Fee Changes</h2>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            CTRL+Filing Inc. may modify Subscription fees at its sole discretion.
            Any changes will take effect at the end of the current Billing
            Cycle.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            We will provide at least 60 days prior notice of any changes to professional
            subscribers to allow for practice management planning. Continued
            use of the Service after fee changes take effect constitutes your
            agreement to the new fees.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Refunds</h2>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            Refund requests may be considered on a case-by-case basis and are
            granted at the sole discretion of CTRL+Filing Inc. Professional
            subscribers may receive prorated refunds for service disruptions
            that materially impact practice operations.
          </p>

          <h2>16. Governing Law</h2>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            These Terms are governed by the laws of the United States and the
            state of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law rules.
            Professional obligations and standards are governed by applicable
            state and federal regulations for accounting professionals.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            Failure to enforce any part of the Terms does not waive our rights.
            If any provision is found to be invalid, the remainder remains in
            effect. Professional regulatory requirements take precedence over
            conflicting commercial terms.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and CTRL+Filing
            Inc. regarding the Service, supplementing but not replacing your
            professional obligations and regulatory requirements.
          </p>

          </p>
